# summer-playgrounds
Space to add the playgrounds we do during the summer coming up to speed course

The playground for the classes can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZQDhq9oPvTci-wCF0pcHXERaYF-0Mx42?usp=drive_link

The video tutorials can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx2qaC0Xa2RtFxnd4NvP0Rs8rR_9NhuUP

When commiting your playground, add your last name first followed by "PlayGroundX" where "X" is the number of it. Add it to the corresponding folder so we have some organization :)

Happy coding!
